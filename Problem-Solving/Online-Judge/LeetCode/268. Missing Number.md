# Missing Number
[LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/missing-number/)

## Problem Description

Given an array nums containing n distinct numbers in the range [0, n], return the only number in the range that is missing from the array.

## Example

Example 1:
```
Input: nums = [3,0,1]

Output: 2
```
Explanation:

n = 3 since there are 3 numbers, so all numbers are in the range [0,3]. 2 is the missing number in the range since it does not appear in nums.

Example 2:
```
Input: nums = [0,1]

Output: 2
```
Explanation:

n = 2 since there are 2 numbers, so all numbers are in the range [0,2]. 2 is the missing number in the range since it does not appear in nums.

Example 3:
```
Input: nums = [9,6,4,2,3,5,7,0,1]

Output: 8
```
Explanation:

n = 9 since there are 9 numbers, so all numbers are in the range [0,9]. 8 is the missing number in the range since it does not appear in nums.
 

Constraints:

*   n == nums.length
*   1 <= n <= 104
*   0 <= nums[i] <= n
*   All the numbers of nums are unique.
## Solution
```cpp
//0ms version
class Solution {
public:
    int missingNumber(vector<int>& nums) {
        long long int total = ((1+nums.size())*nums.size())/2;
        for(auto&c:nums)total-=c;
        return total;
    }
};
```
## Explanation

這題，他是說會缺少一個數字，那這個數字的範圍是[0,n]，所以我們可以先用等差數列的公式算出總和，再用for loop把nums的數字扣掉，剩下的就是缺少的數字

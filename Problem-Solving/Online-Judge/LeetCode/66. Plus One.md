# Plus One
[LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/plus-one/)

## Problem Description

You are given a large integer represented as an integer array `digits`, where each `digits`[i] is the $i^{th}$ digit of the integer. The digits are ordered from most significant to least significant in left-to-right order. The large integer does not contain any leading `0`'s.

Increment the large integer by one and return the resulting array of digits.

 
## Example & constraints
Example 1:
```
Input: digits = [1,2,3]
Output: [1,2,4]
```
Explanation: The array represents the integer 123.
Incrementing by one gives 123 + 1 = 124.
Thus, the result should be [1,2,4]. <br>
Example 2:
```
Input: digits = [4,3,2,1]
Output: [4,3,2,2]
```
Explanation: The array represents the integer 4321.
Incrementing by one gives 4321 + 1 = 4322.
Thus, the result should be [4,3,2,2]. <br>
Example 3:
```
Input: digits = [9]
Output: [1,0]
```
Explanation: The array represents the integer 9.
Incrementing by one gives 9 + 1 = 10.
Thus, the result should be [1,0]. <br>

Constraints:

1. 1 <= digits.length <= 100
2. 0 <= digits[i] <= 9
3. digits does not contain any leading 0's.


## Solution
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> plusOne(vector<int>& digits) {
        int carry = 1,n=digits.size()-1;
        for(int i=n;i>=0;i--){
            int sum = carry + digits[i];
            digits[i] = sum % 10;
            carry = sum /= 10;
            
        }
        if(carry)digits.insert(digits.begin(),carry);
        return digits;
    }
};
``` 
## Explanation
*   **Edge Case Handling**: A typical edge case is when the most significant digit is 9 (causing a carry overflow, e.g., `99` becomes `100`), which requires inserting a `1` at the beginning. By consistently applying the numeral system logic, we avoid needing special checks for this inside the main loop.
*   **Numeral System Logic**: We update digits using standard arithmetic operations:
    *   `sum % 10`: updates the current digit (keeps it between 0-9).
    *   `sum / 10`: calculates the carry for the next position.
    If the sum exceeds 9, the carry becomes 1 (adding to the next digit); otherwise, it becomes 0.
## Time Complexity
*  $O(n)$

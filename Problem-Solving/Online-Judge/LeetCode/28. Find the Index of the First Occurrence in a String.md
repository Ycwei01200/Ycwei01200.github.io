# Find the Index of the First Occurrence in a String
[LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-index-of-the-first-occurrence-in-a-string/)

## Problem Description

Given two strings `needle` and `haystack`, return the index of the first occurrence of `needle` in `haystack`, or -1 if `needle` is not part of `haystack`.

 
## Example & constraints
Example 1:
```
Input: haystack = "sadbutsad", needle = "sad"
Output: 0
```
Explanation: "sad" occurs at index 0 and 6.
The first occurrence is at index 0, so we return 0.

Example 2:
```
Input: haystack = "leetcode", needle = "leeto"
Output: -1
```
Explanation: 
"leeto" did not occur in "leetcode", so we return -1.

Constraints:

1. 1 <= haystack.length, needle.length <= $10^4$
2. haystack and needle consist of only lowercase English characters.


## Solution
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int strStr(string haystack, string needle) {
        int n = needle.size();
        int m = haystack.size();
        string temp;
        
        for(int i=0;m-i>=n;i++){
            if(haystack[i]==needle[0]){
                temp = haystack.substr(i,n);
                if(temp==needle){return i;}
            }
        }
        return -1;
    }
};
``` 
## Explanation
*  the for-loop is used to find the first letter of the `needle` in the `haystack`,and than compare the `needle` with the `haystack` from the first letter of the `needle`(by `substr` function) in the `haystack`.
## Time Complexity
*  $O(m * n)$

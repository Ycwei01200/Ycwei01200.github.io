# Search Insert Position
[LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/search-insert-position/)

## Problem Description

Given a sorted array of distinct integers and a target value, return the index if the target is found. If not, return the index where it would be if it were inserted in order.

You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.

 
## Example & constraints
Example 1:
```
Input: nums = [1,3,5,6], target = 5
Output: 2
```
Example 2:
```
Input: nums = [1,3,5,6], target = 2
Output: 1
```
Example 3:
```
Input: nums = [1,3,5,6], target = 7
Output: 4
```
Constraints:

1. 1 <= nums.length <= $10^4$
2. $-10^4$ <= nums[i] <= $10^4$
3. nums contains distinct values sorted in ascending order.
4. $-10^4$ <= target <= $10^4$


## Solution
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int searchInsert(vector<int>& nums, int target) {
        int left = 0,right = nums.size()-1;
        while(left<=right){
            int mid = left + (right-left)/2;
            if(nums[mid]>target)        {right = mid - 1;}
            else if(nums[mid] == target){return mid;}
            else if(nums[mid] < target) {left = mid +1;}          
        }
        return left;
    }
};
``` 
## Explanation
*  the algorithm is `binary search`,and the time complexity is $O(log n)$
*  the most important thing is that the `left` is the answer because when the `while` loop ends, the `left` is the first element that is greater than the `target`
*  if the `target` is not in the `nums`, the `left` index would be Continued to increase until it is greater than the `target`.
## Time Complexity
*  $O(log n)$

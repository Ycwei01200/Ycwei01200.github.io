# Is Subsequence

[LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/is-subsequence/)

## Problem Description

Given two strings s and t, return true if s is a subsequence of t, or false otherwise.

A subsequence of a string is a new string that is formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. (i.e., "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde" while "aec" is not).
 
## Example & constraints
Example 1:
```
Input: s = "abc", t = "ahbgdc"
Output: true
```
Example 2:
```
Input: s = "axc", t = "ahbgdc"
Output: false
```
Constraints:

*   0 <= s.length <= $100$
*   0 <= t.length <= $10^4$
*   s and t consist only of lowercase English letters.
  
Follow up: Suppose there are lots of incoming s, say s1, s2, ..., sk where k >= 109, and you want to check one by one to see if t has its subsequence. In this scenario, how would you change your code?

## Solution
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool isSubsequence(string s, string t) {
        if(s.size()==0)return true;
        int left=0,right=0;
        while(left<s.size()&&right<t.size()){
            if(s[left] == t[right])left++;

            right++;
        }
        return left == s.size();

    }
};
```

## Explanation
*  這題我用雙指標做，因為，s是作為主要的字串，因為有s才能去跟t做對應，並且題目有提到，順序要相同，所以，`慢指標`給s，`快指標`給t，理想狀況是如果都有按順序對應，那s的慢指標最後會跑到`s.size()`，如果沒有就代表順序不對，或者是t根本沒這個字母。
  
## Time Complexity
*  $O(n)$
## Space Complexity
*  $O(1)$

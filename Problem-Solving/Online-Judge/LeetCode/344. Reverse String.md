# Reverse String
[LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-string/)

## Problem Description

Write a function that reverses a string. The input string is given as an array of characters s.

You must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.

## Example

Example 1:
```
Input: s = ["h","e","l","l","o"]
Output: ["o","l","l","e","h"]
```

Example 2:
```
Input: s = ["H","a","n","n","a","h"]
Output: ["h","a","n","n","a","H"]
```
Constraints:

*   1 <= s.length <= $10^5$
*   s[i] is a printable ascii character.

## Solution
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    void reverseString(vector<char>& s) {
        int left = 0,right = s.size()-1;
        while(left <= right){
            swap(s[left],s[right]);
            left++;right--;
        }
    
```
## Explanation
*  這題，雙指標秒了，一個放最前面，一個放最後面，然後交換完就往中間移動，直到兩個指標相遇


  
## Time Complexity
### Two Pointers
*  $O(n)$

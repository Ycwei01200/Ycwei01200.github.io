# Guess Number Higher or Lower

[LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/guess-number-higher-or-lower/)

## Problem Description

We are playing the Guess Game. The game is as follows:

I pick a number from 1 to n. You have to guess which number I picked (the number I picked stays the same throughout the game).

Every time you guess wrong, I will tell you whether the number I picked is higher or lower than your guess.

You call a pre-defined API int guess(int num), which returns three possible results:

`-1`: Your guess is higher than the number I picked <br> (i.e. `num > pick`).
`1`: Your guess is lower than the number I picked <br> (i.e. `num < pick`).
`0`: your guess is equal to the number I picked <br> (i.e. `num == pick`).
Return the number that I picked.

## Example

Example 1:
```
Input: n = 10, pick = 6
Output: 6
```
Example 2:
```
Input: n = 1, pick = 1
Output: 1
```
Example 3:
```
Input: n = 2, pick = 1
Output: 1
```
## Constrains

*   1 <= n <= $2^{31}$ - 1
*   1 <= pick <= n
## Solution

```cpp
/** 
 * Forward declaration of guess API.
 * @param  num   your guess
 * @return 	     -1 if num is higher than the picked number
 *			      1 if num is lower than the picked number
 *               otherwise return 0
 * int guess(int num);
 */

class Solution {
public:
    int guessNumber(int n) {
        int left = 1, right = n;
        while(left<=right){
            int mid = left + (right-left)/2;
            if(guess(mid)==(-1)){
                right = mid - 1;
            }
            else if(guess(mid) == 1){
                left = mid + 1;
            }
            else{
                return mid;
            }
        }
        return -1;
    }
};
```


## Explanation
*  這一題用二分搜應該是最理想的方式，因為範圍是`1~n`裡面，並且每次都會告訴你是高是低，也跟二分搜相同，調整上下界的方式，得到答案，用`for-loop從1~N`不知道會不會TLE，但不建議。

## Time Complexity
*  $O(log n)$

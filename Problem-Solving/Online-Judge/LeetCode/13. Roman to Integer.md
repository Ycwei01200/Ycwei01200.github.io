# Roman to Integer

[LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/roman-to-integer/)

## Problem Description

Roman numerals are represented by seven different symbols: **I**, **V**, **X**, **L**, **C**, **D** and **M**.

| Symbol | Value |
| ------ | ----- |
| I      | 1     |
| V      | 5     |
| X      | 10    |
| L      | 50    |
| C      | 100   |
| D      | 500   |
| M      | 1000  |

For example, `2` is written as `II` in Roman numeral, just two ones added together. `12` is written as `XII`, which is simply `X + II`. The number `27` is written as `XXVII`, which is `XX + V + II`.

Roman numerals are usually written largest to smallest from left to right. However, the numeral for four is not `IIII`. Instead, the number four is written as `IV`. Because the one is before the five we subtract it making four. The same principle applies to the number nine, which is written as `IX`. 

There are six instances where subtraction is used:

* `I` can be placed before `V` (5) and `X` (10) to make 4 and 9
* `X` can be placed before `L` (50) and `C` (100) to make 40 and 90
* `C` can be placed before `D` (500) and `M` (1000) to make 400 and 900

Given a roman numeral, convert it to an integer.

## Example

```cpp
Input: s = "III"
Output: 3
```

```cpp
Input: s = "LVIII"
Output: 58
```

```cpp
Input: s = "MCMXCIV"
Output: 1994
```

## Solution

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int romanToInt(string s) {
        ios::sync_with_stdio(0), cin.tie(0);
        map<char,int> p = { {'I',1},{'V',5},{'X',10},{'L',50},{'C',100},{'D',500},{'M',1000}};
        long long int val = 0;
        bool check = false;
        for(int i = 0 ; i < s.size() ;i++){
            if(i+1<s.size()&&p[s[i]] < p[s[i+1]]){
                val += abs(p[s[i]]- p[s[i+1]]);i++;
            }
            else
                val += p[s[i]];
        }
        return val;
    }
};


```
## Explanation
*  To create a map , we can use the map to quicky find the value of the roman numeral
*  if the value of the roman numeral is smaller than the next one, we can use the absolute value to find the difference
*  if the value of the roman numeral is greater than or equal to the next one, we can add the value to the result
*  return the result

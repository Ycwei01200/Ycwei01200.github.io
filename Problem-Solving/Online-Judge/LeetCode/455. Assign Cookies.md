# 455. Assign Cookies

[LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/assign-cookies/)

## Problem Description

Assume you are an awesome parent and want to give your children some cookies. But, you should give each child at most one cookie.

Each child i has a greed factor g[i], which is the minimum size of a cookie that the child will be content with; and each cookie j has a size s[j]. If s[j] >= g[i], we can assign the cookie j to the child i, and the child i will be content. Your goal is to maximize the number of your content children and output the maximum number.

 
## Example & constraints
Example 1:
```
Input: g = [1,2,3], s = [1,1]
Output: 1
```
Explanation: You have 3 children and 2 cookies. The greed factors of 3 children are 1, 2, 3. 
And even though you have 2 cookies, since their size is both 1, you could only make the child whose greed factor is 1 content.
You need to output 1.
Example 2:
```
Input: g = [1,2], s = [1,2,3]
Output: 2
```
Explanation: You have 2 children and 3 cookies. The greed factors of 2 children are 1, 2. 
You have 3 cookies and their sizes are big enough to gratify all of the children, 
You need to output 2.
 
### Constraints:

*   $1 <= g.length <= 3 * 10^4$
*   $0 <= s.length <= 3 * 10^4$
*   $1 <= g[i], s[j] <= 2^{31} - 1$
 

Note: This question is the same as 2410: Maximum Matching of Players With Trainers.

## Solution
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int findContentChildren(vector<int>& g, vector<int>& s) {
        sort(g.begin(),g.end());
        sort(s.begin(),s.end());
        int count = 0, children = 0 , cookie = 0;
        while(children < g.size() && cookie < s.size()){
            if(g[children] > s[cookie]){
                cookie++;
            }
            else{
                count++;children++;cookie++;
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
};
```


## Explanation
*  這題的意思是說，有`g`個小孩，每個小孩有`g[i]`的胃口，有`n`個餅乾，每個餅乾有`s[j]`的大小，請問最多可以讓多少個小孩吃到餅乾？
*  那最理想的狀態就是每個小孩都能吃到餅乾，我們可以先排序兩個陣列，然後來去比大小(這邊要注意，小孩的胃口跟餅乾的大小不同，沒辦法只靠比單一個數字來判斷)，所以我們會用雙指針的方式，如果餅乾的份量比小孩的胃口小，那代表餅幹要找更大的，所以餅乾的指標要往後移，反之，如果餅乾的分量大於等於小孩的胃口，那就可以給小孩吃，所以兩個陣列的指標都往後移動，直到其中一個陣列遍歷完為止。

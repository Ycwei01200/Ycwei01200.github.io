# Sqrt(x)
[LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/sqrtx/)

## Problem Description

Given a non-negative integer x, return the square root of x rounded down to the nearest integer. The returned integer should be non-negative as well.

You must not use any built-in exponent function or operator.

For example, do not use pow(x, 0.5) in c++ or x ** 0.5 in python.

 
## Example & constraints
Example 1:
```
Input: x = 4
Output: 2
```
Explanation: The square root of 4 is 2, so we return 2.
Example 2:
```
Input: x = 8
Output: 2
```
Explanation: The square root of 8 is 2.82842..., and since we round it down to the nearest integer, 2 is returned.
Constraints:

1. 0 <= x <= $2^{31}-1$

## Solution
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int mySqrt(int x) {
        long long int left=1,right=x;
        while(left<=right){
            long long int mid = left + (right-left)/2;
            if(!mid)return 0;
            if(mid <= x/mid){
                left = mid + 1;
            }
            else{
                right = mid -1;
            }
        }
        return right;
    }
};
``` 
## Explanation
*  When i face these `Monotone function` problems, i would use `binary search` to solve it.
*  The most important thing is that the `right` is the answer because when the `while` loop ends, the `right` is the first element that is less or equal to the `target`
## Time Complexity
*  $O(log n)$

# Length of Last Word
[LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/length-of-last-word/)

## Problem Description

Given a string s consisting of words and spaces, return the length of the last word in the string.

A word is a maximal substring consisting of non-space characters only.

 
## Example & constraints
Example 1:
```
Input: s = "Hello World"
Output: 5
```
Explanation: The last word is "World" with length 5.

Example 2:
```
Input: s = "   fly me   to   the moon  "
Output: 4
```
Explanation: The last word is "moon" with length 4.

Example 3:
```
Input: s = "luffy is still joyboy"
Output: 6
```
Explanation: The last word is "joyboy" with length 6.

Constraints:

1. 1 <= s.length <= 104
2. s consists of only English letters and spaces ' '.
3. There will be at least one word in s.

## Solution
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int lengthOfLastWord(string s) {
        reverse(s.begin(),s.end());
        int count=0;
        for(int i=0;i<s.size();i++){
            if(s[i]==' '&&count!=0){return count;}
            
            if(s[i]==' ')continue;
            else         count++;
        }
        return count;
    }
};
``` 
## Explanation
*  the algorithm is `reverse`,and the time complexity is $O(n)$
## Time Complexity
*  $O(n)$
